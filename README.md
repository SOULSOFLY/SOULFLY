# SoulFly Name Claimed by Sanjeeva Senaka,September 6, 2025
SoulFly Claiming the Sky for Every Soul SoulFly is more than a name. It is a movement, a beacon, a call to ascend. In a world weighed down by distraction, greed, and disconnection, SoulFly reminds us that the only true currency is the one that lives in our hearts: love, kindness, presence, and generosity. This repository is a marker. A digital declaration. A proof that the vision exists, that the energy is real, and that one day it will lift all those who choose to rise. SoulFly is the passport to higher living, a flight plan for the soul. Here, wings are built from compassion. Altitude is measured in courage. Every transaction, every act, every exchange is an acknowledgment of humanity’s potential to care, to share, to elevate. We are the flyers of the infinite. We do not wait for permission. We do not count likes or followers. We soar because we are already free, because love is the fuel, and because our destination has always been within us. Welcome aboard. This is the takeoff. SoulFly — where every soul earns its wings. SoulFly is inspired by the spiritual and literary work of Sanjeeva Senaka, author of *FLY: First Class for the Soul*. Just as *FLY* guides readers through life as a journey of presence, generosity, and love, SoulFly rewards real-world acts of kindness and connection—turning the ethos of the book into a living, breathing community.
